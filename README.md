# polymarket-midterms

This repository contains data for every trade in csv format for 39 US 2022 midterms-related prediction markets hosted on [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com/). Polymarket is a platform that hosts prediction markets on topics such as politics, sports, and pop culture, with over $200 million USD in total historical trading volume.

The data is scraped from Jeff Rossiter's [PolymarketWhales](https://twitter.com/PolymarktWhales).

## Data

The data is in the folder called polymarket-midterms-data. 

There is also an Excel file, polymarket-search-book.xlsx, with the full name, short name, and webpage link (with the first 100 trades only).

## Code

All of the code used to scrape and process the data is in an R notebook uploaded to this repository.

## Analysis

I sketch two potential uses for this sort of data in the R notebook. A code-free version (for readability) is in the file called analysis.md.
